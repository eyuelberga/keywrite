# The Ethiopic Script

### Overview

Ethiopic script is an ancient writing system used by multiple languages in the Horn of Africa, primarily in Ethiopia and Eritrea. The script is syllabic, meaning each character (called a **syllograph**) represents a consonant-vowel combination rather than individual letters.

### Languages Using Ethiopic Script

-   **Amharic** - Official language of Ethiopia
-   **Tigrinya** - Spoken in Eritrea and northern Ethiopia
-   **Ge'ez** - Classical liturgical language
-   **Harari** - Spoken in eastern Ethiopia
-   **Tigre** - Spoken in Eritrea
-   **Blin, Awngi, Sebatbeit** - Various Ethiopian languages

### Script Characteristics

The Ethiopic syllabary features:

-   **Base consonants** (e.g., መ, ለ, ሰ)
-   **Seven orders** (vowel variations) for most consonants
-   Additional orders for some syllographs (up to 14 orders)
-   **Labiovelar forms** (w-modified consonants)
-   Unique punctuation and numeral systems

## The Mnemonic Approach

### Why Mnemonic Input Methods?

Since Ethiopic script is not natively supported by standard QWERTY keyboards, an input method is necessary. The **mnemonic approach** leverages cognitive associations between Latin letters and Ethiopic sounds, making the system:

-   **Intuitive** - Minimal learning required
-   **Natural** - Based on phonetic correspondence
-   **Efficient** - Optimized for common patterns
-   **Consistent** - Predictable across languages

### Core Principles

#### 1. Character Class Continuity

Characters map within their class:

-   **Letters → Letters**
-   **Numbers → Numbers**
-   **Punctuation → Punctuation**

#### 2. Phonological Continuity

Letters map based on phonetic correspondence (transliteration norms):

```
Latin 'm' sound → Ethiopic 'መ' (m sound)
Latin 's' sound → Ethiopic 'ስ' (s sound)
Latin 'sh' sound → Ethiopic 'ሽ' (sh sound)
```

#### 3. Case-Independent Vowels

Vowel components map to both upper and lowercase Latin letters:

```
ma → ማ
Ma → ማ
mA → ማ
MA → ማ
```

This prevents "shift-slip" errors when typing quickly.

#### 4. Continuity of Function (Punctuation)

Punctuation maps based on functional role:

```
Latin comma (,) → Ethiopic comma (፣)
Latin period (.) → Ethiopic full stop (።)
Latin colon (:) → Ethiopic wordspace (፡)
```

#### 5. Continuity of Quantity (Numbers)

Numbers map by value, not appearance:

```
1 → ፩
2 → ፪
10 → ፲
```

#### 6. Kinesthetic-Visual Feedback

Every keystroke produces immediate visual feedback. **No dead keys** are used - every key press results in a visible character or character modification.

## Ethiopic Syllable Composition

### The Orders System

Ethiopic syllographs are organized into **orders** based on their vowel component. Most consonant families have 7 orders:

| Order | IPA | Example (m-family) | Sound Description            |
| ----- | --- | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| 1st   | +ə  | መ                  | Schwa vowel (like 'uh')      |
| 2nd   | +u  | ሙ                  | 'oo' as in 'food'            |
| 3rd   | +i  | ሚ                  | 'ee' as in 'see'             |
| 4th   | +a  | ማ                  | 'ah' as in 'father'          |
| 5th   | +e  | ሜ                  | 'ay' as in 'day'             |
| 6th   | +ɨ  | ም                  | Base consonant (light schwa) |
| 7th   | +o  | ሞ                  | 'oh' as in 'go'              |

The **6th order** is the base form and the most frequently occurring, so it requires no vowel keystroke.

### Keystroke Mapping

The standard vowel key mappings are:

| Vowel Key   | Order        | Example Output |
| ----------- | ------------ | -------------- |
| `e`         | 1st (ə)      | `me` → መ       |
| `u`         | 2nd          | `mu` → ሙ       |
| `i`         | 3rd          | `mi` → ሚ       |
| `a`         | 4th          | `ma` → ማ       |
| `ie` or `I` | 5th (long e) | `mie` → ሜ      |
| _(none)_    | 6th          | `m` → ም        |
| `o`         | 7th          | `mo` → ሞ       |

### The Complete መ (m) Family

Here's the full composition table for the m-family showing all keystroke patterns:

| IPA | Keys  | Character | Labiovelar Keys | Labiovelar |
| --- | ----- | --------- | --------------- | ---------- |
| +ə  | `me`  | መ         | `mue`           | ᎀ          |
| +u  | `mu`  | ሙ         | `muu`           | ᎃ          |
| +i  | `mi`  | ሚ         | `mui`           | ᎁ          |
| +a  | `ma`  | ማ         | `mua`           | ሟ          |
| +e  | `mie` | ሜ         | `muie`          | ᎂ          |
| +ɨ  | `m`   | ም         | -               | -          |
| +o  | `mo`  | ሞ         | -               | -          |
| +ɔ  | `moa` | ⶁ         | -               | -          |

### Extended Orders

Some syllographs have up to 14 orders, including:

-   **Labiovelar forms** (7th-12th orders) - w-modified versions
-   **Additional vowel variants** - Language-specific forms

## Consonant Mappings

### Standard Consonants

Basic consonants map phonetically to QWERTY keys:

| Latin Key | Ethiopic Base | IPA | Example  |
| --------- | ------------- | --- | -------- |
| `h`       | ህ             | h   | `ha` → ሃ |
| `l`       | ል             | l   | `la` → ላ |
| `m`       | ም             | m   | `ma` → ማ |
| `s`       | ስ             | s   | `sa` → ሳ |
| `r`       | ር             | r   | `ra` → ራ |
| `b`       | ብ             | b   | `ba` → ባ |
| `t`       | ት             | t   | `ta` → ታ |
| `n`       | ን             | n   | `na` → ና |
| `k`       | ክ             | k   | `ka` → ካ |
| `w`       | ው             | w   | `wa` → ዋ |
| `z`       | ዝ             | z   | `za` → ዛ |
| `y`       | ይ             | y   | `ya` → ያ |
| `d`       | ድ             | d   | `da` → ዳ |
| `g`       | ግ             | g   | `ga` → ጋ |
| `f`       | ፍ             | f   | `fa` → ፋ |
| `p`       | ፕ             | p   | `pa` → ፓ |

### Ejective Consonants

Ejective phonemes (sounds produced with a glottal closure) use **uppercase** letters:

| Latin Key  | Ethiopic Base | IPA | Example  |
| ---------- | ------------- | --- | -------- |
| `q` or `Q` | ቅ             | k'  | `qa` → ቃ |
| `T`        | ጥ             | t'  | `Ta` → ጣ |
| `P`        | ጵ             | p'  | `Pa` → ጳ |
| `S`        | ጽ             | s'  | `Sa` → ጻ |
| `C`        | ጭ             | ch' | `Ca` → ጫ |

### Special Mappings

Some consonants use alternative keys to avoid conflicts:

| Latin Key | Ethiopic Base | Reason                    |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| `x`       | ሽ             | 'sh' sound, `x` is unused |
| `c`       | ች             | 'ch' sound                |
| `j`       | ጅ             | 'j' sound                 |
| `N`       | ኝ             | palatal n (ny sound)      |
| `Z`       | ዥ             | voiced 'zh' sound         |

### Pharyngeal and Glottal Consonants

| Latin Key | Ethiopic Base | Description         |
| --------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| `H`       | ሕ             | Pharyngeal h (ħ)    |
| `hh`      | ኅ             | Velar fricative (x) |
| `K`       | ኽ             | Velar k             |

## Lone Vowels (Glottal and Pharyngeal)

Ethiopic has standalone vowel syllographs that represent glottal stop + vowel combinations. These are among the trickiest mappings in any Ethiopic input method.

### Glottal Vowels (አ family)

The glottal vowels can be entered in **three ways** for maximum flexibility:

#### Method 1: Vowels as Vowels (Single Keystroke)

Most intuitive for experienced typists:

| Key  | Output | IPA |
| ---- | ------ | --- |
| `u`  | ኡ      | ʔu  |
| `i`  | ኢ      | ʔi  |
| `ie` | ኤ      | ʔe  |
| `e`  | እ      | ʔɨ  |
| `o`  | ኦ      | ʔo  |

#### Method 2: As Syllographs (Starting from 6th Order)

Treating them like any other consonant family:

| Keys         | Output | IPA                 |
| ------------ | ------ | ------------------- |
| `e`          | እ      | ʔɨ (6th order base) |
| `ee` or `ea` | አ      | ʔə (1st order)      |
| `eu`         | ኡ      | ʔu (2nd order)      |
| `ei`         | ኢ      | ʔi (3rd order)      |
| `ea`         | ኣ      | ʔa (4th order)      |
| `eie`        | ኤ      | ʔe (5th order)      |
| `eo`         | ኦ      | ʔo (7th order)      |

#### Method 3: Starting from 1st Order

Traditional approach starting with 'a':

| Keys  | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| `a`   | አ      |
| `au`  | ኡ      |
| `ai`  | ኢ      |
| `aa`  | ኣ      |
| `aie` | ኤ      |
| `ae`  | እ      |
| `ao`  | ኦ      |

### Pharyngeal Vowels (ዐ family)

Double-strike of vowel keys produces pharyngeal counterparts:

| Keys | Output | IPA |
| ---- | ------ | --- |
| `uu` | ዑ      | ʕu  |
| `ii` | ዒ      | ʕi  |
| `ee` | ዕ      | ʕɨ  |
| `oo` | ዖ      | ʕo  |
| `AA` | ዐ      | ʕə  |

### Amharic Homophonic Vowels

In Amharic, the pharyngeal phoneme is lost, making several vowels homophonic. The "short-a" phoneme is shared by four syllographs:

| Keys   | Output | Frequency   |
| ------ | ------ | ----------- |
| `a`    | አ      | Most common |
| `aa`   | ዓ      | Less common |
| `aaa`  | ዐ      | Rare        |
| `aaaa` | ኣ      | Rarest      |

### Eritrean Conventions

In Eritrean Tigrinya, modern writing strictly uses 4th order forms:

| Keys   | Output | Note                          |
| ------ | ------ | ----------------------------- |
| `a`    | ኣ      | Default (4th order preferred) |
| `aa`   | ዓ      | Pharyngeal a                  |
| `aaa`  | ዐ      | Pharyngeal base               |
| `aaaa` | አ      | 1st order (archaic)           |

## Phonological Redundancy

Many Ethiopic languages have multiple syllographs representing the same sound (homophones). Keywrite handles this through **double-strike** patterns.

### Amharic h-sounds

Four syllographs represent "h" in Amharic:

| Keys | Output | Origin                                |
| ---- | ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `h`  | ህ      | Default h                             |
| `hh` | ኅ      | Velar h                               |
| `H`  | ሕ      | Pharyngeal h (borrowed from Tigrinya) |
| `K`  | ኽ      | From k-family (borrowed)              |

### Amharic s-sounds

| Keys | Output | Note          |
| ---- | ------ | ------------- |
| `s`  | ስ      | Most frequent |
| `ss` | ሥ      | Less frequent |

### Amharic ṣ-sounds (ejective s)

| Keys | Output | Note             |
| ---- | ------ | ---------------- |
| `S`  | ጽ      | Most common      |
| `SS` | ፅ      | Rare alternative |

## Labiovelar Forms

Some consonants have **labiovelar** variants (w-modified forms), primarily in the k/q and g families. These represent consonant + w + vowel combinations.

### Standard Labiovelar Composition

For consonants like k (ከ) and q (ቀ):

| Keys | Standard | Keys  | Labiovelar | IPA |
| ---- | -------- | ----- | ---------- | --- |
| `ka` | ካ        | `kua` | ኳ          | kʷa |
| `ku` | ኩ        | `kuu` | ኵ          | kʷu |
| `ki` | ኪ        | `kui` | ኲ          | kʷi |
| `ke` | ከ        | `kue` | ኰ          | kʷe |

The labiovelar forms are entered by inserting `u` after the consonant.

### Alternative Labiovelar Entry

Double vowel patterns also produce labiovelars:

| Keys  | Output | Equivalent to                |
| ----- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| `kuu` | ኵ      | `kuu`                        |
| `koo` | ኰ      | `kue` (7th order labiovelar) |
| `quu` | ቍ      | `quu`                        |
| `qoo` | ቈ      | `que`                        |

## Punctuation

### Modern Ethiopic Punctuation

| Keys | Output | Name                   | Function                |
| ---- | ------ | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `:`  | ፡      | Wordspace              | Separates words         |
| `::` | ።      | Full Stop              | End of sentence         |
| `,`  | ፣      | Comma                  | Sentence pause          |
| `,,` | ፥      | Comma (ecclesiastical) | Used in religious texts |
| `;`  | ፤      | Semicolon              | Clause separator        |
| `:-` | ፦      | Preface Colon          | Before quotations       |
| `_`  | ፟      | Paragraph Separator    | Section break           |

### Special Punctuation Rules

**Accessing Latin Punctuation:**

Since Ethiopic punctuation occupies the main keys, Latin equivalents require double-strikes:

| Keys  | Output | Note             |
| ----- | ------ | ---------------- |
| `,,,` | ,      | ASCII comma      |
| `;;`  | ;      | ASCII semicolon  |
| `:::` | :      | ASCII colon      |
| `__`  | \_     | ASCII underscore |
| `''`  | '      | ASCII apostrophe |

### Archaic Punctuation (Ge'ez only)

Used in classical Ge'ez texts:

| Keys           | Output | Name                |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------------- |
| `:,`           | ፥      | Comma               |
| `:#` or `:::`  | ፨      | Paragraph separator |
| `:+` or `::::` | ፠      | Section mark        |
| `:?`           | ፧      | Question mark       |

### Quotation Marks (Guillemets)

Ethiopic uses angle quotation marks (guillemets):

| Keys  | Output | Name                   |
| ----- | ------ | ---------------------- |
| `<`   | `‹`    | Single left guillemet  |
| `<<`  | `«`    | Double left guillemet  |
| `>`   | `›`    | Single right guillemet |
| `>>`  | `»`    | Double right guillemet |
| `<<<` | `<`    | ASCII less-than        |
| `>>>` | `>`    | ASCII greater-than     |

## Numerals

Ethiopic has its own numeral system based on letters (similar to Roman numerals). Three support levels exist:

### Numeral System Overview

The Ethiopic numeral system is non-positional and uses combinations of symbols:

-   **፩-፱** represent 1-9
-   **፲-፺** represent 10-90 (by tens)
-   **፻** represents 100
-   **፼** represents 10,000

### Default Numeral Entry

By default, western Arabic digits (0-9) are used. To enter Ethiopic numerals, prefix with apostrophe (`'`):

| Keys     | Output | Value |
| -------- | ------ | ----- |
| `'1`     | ፩      | 1     |
| `'2`     | ፪      | 2     |
| `'10`    | ፲      | 10    |
| `'100`   | ፻      | 100   |
| `'1000`  | ፲፻     | 1000  |
| `'10000` | ፼      | 10000 |

### Minimal Support Level

Direct mappings from western digits to Ethiopic numerals:

| Keys   | Output | Value |
| ------ | ------ | ----- |
| `'1`   | ፩      | 1     |
| `'2`   | ፪      | 2     |
| `'3`   | ፫      | 3     |
| `'4`   | ፬      | 4     |
| `'5`   | ፭      | 5     |
| `'6`   | ፮      | 6     |
| `'7`   | ፯      | 7     |
| `'8`   | ፰      | 8     |
| `'9`   | ፱      | 9     |
| `'10`  | ፲      | 10    |
| `'20`  | ፳      | 20    |
| `'100` | ፻      | 100   |

### Intermediate Support Level

Additional mappings for orders of ten up to 10⁸:

```
'200  → ፪፻
'1000 → ፲፻
'2000 → ፳፻
'10000 → ፼
'100000 → ፲፼
'1000000 → ፻፼
```

### Maximal Support Level

Algorithmic conversion from any western numeric value to Ethiopic sequence. Implementation-specific, with no upper bound.

### Ge'ez Default

In Ge'ez and "Unified Ethiopic" input methods, **Ethiopic numerals are the default**. Use apostrophe to switch to western digits:

```
1 → ፩   (Ethiopic)
'1 → 1  (Western)
```

## Language-Specific Input Methods

## Special Composition Rules

### The Apostrophe Rule

The apostrophe (`'`) serves special functions:

#### 1. Numeral Context Switch

```
1 → 1 (western)
'1 → ፩ (Ethiopic)
```

#### 2. Composition Termination

When a consonant is followed by a lone vowel, apostrophe prevents composition:

```
ma → ማ (single syllable)
m'a → ም + አ (consonant + vowel, two syllables)
```

#### 3. Double Apostrophe

```
'' → ' (literal apostrophe character)
```

### The Double-o and Double-u Rule

For classic Ge'ez characters, double vowels access alternate forms:

```
qu → ቁ (2nd order)
quu → ቍ (labiovelar u)

qo → ቆ (7th order)
qoo → ቈ (labiovelar e/o)
```

This helps disambiguate similar orders:

| Syllograph | Standard | Double | Pattern             |
| ---------- | -------- | ------ | ------------------- |
| ቁ/ቍ        | `qu`     | `quu`  | 2nd vs labiovelar u |
| ቆ/ቈ        | `qo`     | `qoo`  | 7th vs labiovelar o |
| ኁ/ኍ        | `hu`     | `huu`  | Same pattern        |
| ኁ/ኆ        | `ho`     | `hoo`  | Same pattern        |

### The Irregular Vowel ኧ

Amharic and Sebatbeit use the irregular vowel ኧ:

```
ae → ኧ
aee → እ (standard e form)
```

In Sebatbeit, ኧ replaces ኣ in the syllabary order.

### Language-Specific Homophone Patterns

Different languages handle homophones differently:

**Amharic:**

```
s → ስ
ss → ሥ
```

**Tigrinya (both):**

```
s → ስ
ss → ሥ (but phonologically distinct)
```

**Sebatbeit:**

```
S → ፅ (only, ጽ not used)
```
