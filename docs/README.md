# Keywrite

> _type non-latin scripts on the web_

**Keywrite** is a JavaScript library that allows you to type non-latin scripts in any web based application using a standard keyboard. You can add it to your text input controls and start typing with your configured input-method.

The aim of this project is to enable web developers to add support for typing non-latin based texts on web and hybrid applications, so users can type different languages without configuring their operating system or installing additional software.

## Examples

[See examples of Keywrite here](examples.md)

## The Basics

**What does Keywrite do?**

1. It allows you to translate key strokes to non-latin characters, which you define in a input-method configuration file.
1. It binds with web input controls to add multi-lingual typing to your web application

**Things you can build with Keywrite**

1. A web form you want to be filled in a certain language [See Demo]()
1. A textfield with multiple language support [See Demo]()
1. A web-based rich-text editor which you can type in multiple languages [See Demo]()
