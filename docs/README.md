### What is Keywrite?

**Keywrite** is a JavaScript Input Method Editor (IME) library that enables users to input text in languages that cannot be easily represented on a standard QWERTY keyboard.

Built with flexibility and ease of use in mind, Keywrite allows developers to add multi-lingual typing capabilities to web applications through configurable input methods.

**Example:** Type "ni" → "ን", "na" → "ና" in Ethiopic script

### What is an Input Method Editor (IME)?

An **Input Method Editor (IME)** is a utility that provides options to input text in languages that use a keyboard layout other than QWERTY. IMEs help users enter text in languages with larger, more complex character sets, such as Ethiopic, Japanese, Chinese, and Korean.

#### How IMEs Work:

1. **Keystroke Conversion:** You type phonetic sounds or Roman characters (e.g., "ni hao")
2. **Character Mapping:** The IME converts them into the target script (e.g., 你好)
3. **Visual Feedback:** Characters appear on screen as you type

IMEs are essential for languages such as:

-   Ethiopic (Amharic, Tigrinya, Ge'ez)
-   East Asian languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean)
-   Indic languages (Hindi, Bengali, Tamil)
-   Arabic and Hebrew scripts

### Why Keywrite?

Keywrite solves several key challenges when building multi-lingual web applications:

-   **No Native Keyboard Support:** Many languages lack native keyboard layouts on standard devices
-   **Configurable Input Methods:** Define custom key mappings for any language or script
-   **Easy Integration:** Works seamlessly with standard HTML input elements
-   **Lightweight:** Pure JavaScript with no external dependencies
-   **Flexible:** Support multiple input methods in a single application
