# Keywrite

**Keywrite** is a JavaScript Input Method Editor (IME) library for adding configurable input methods to the web. It enables users to input text in a language that can't be represented easily on a standard QWERTY keyboard.

## Examples

[See examples of Keywrite here](examples.md)

## The Basics

**What does Keywrite do?**

1. It allows you to translate key strokes to non-latin characters, which you define in a input-method configuration file.
1. It binds with web input controls to add multi-lingual typing to your web application

**Things you can build with Keywrite**

1. A web form you want to be filled in a certain language [See Demo]()
1. A textfield with multiple language support [See Demo]()
1. A web-based rich-text editor which you can type in multiple languages [See Demo]()
