Keywrite is a JavaScript Input Method Editor (IME) library for adding configurable input methods to the web. It enables users to input text in a language that can't be represented easily on a standard QWERTY keyboard. See the [Docs](https://eyuelberga.github.io/keywrite) for more info.

## Features 🚀

-   **Ease of Use:** Keywrite can be integrated to most modern web frameworks with ease.
-   **Flexible:** You can configure Keywrite with multiple Input-methods, change between them at runtime.
-   **Custom Input Method:** You can easily define your own Input-methods and add them to Keywrite
-   **Fully Extendable:** You can extend the Keywrite core API easily to support different use-cases.
-   **Typescript Support:** The codebase is completely written in typescript

## Installing Keywrite

To use Keywrite on web projects, all you need to do is install the
`@keywrite/web` package:

```sh
yarn add @keywrite/web

# or

npm install @keywrite/web
```
